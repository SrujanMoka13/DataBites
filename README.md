# Awesome Chocolates üç´ Database Analysis 

This repository contains a collection of simple and complex SQL queries designed to analyze the Awesome Chocolates database. The project showcases a wide range of SQL query techniques, from basic operations to advanced data analysis, providing insights into the database's structure and content.

## Features

This project demonstrates the following SQL techniques:

- **Basic Queries:**
  - Data retrieval using `SELECT` statements.
  - Filtering records with the `WHERE` clause.
  - Sorting data with `ORDER BY` (ascending and descending order).
  
- **Intermediate Techniques:**
  - Using `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and `LIKE` operators for conditional filtering.
  - Applying built-in SQL functions like `YEAR()`, `WEEKDAY()`, etc.
  - Creating calculated fields and renaming columns using `AS`.

- **Advanced Queries:**
  - Performing joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.) to combine data from multiple tables.
  - Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and performing aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.).
  - Implementing conditional logic with the `CASE` statement.
  - Writing queries with nested conditions and advanced filtering.
